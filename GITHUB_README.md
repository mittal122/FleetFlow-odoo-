# FleetFlow — Professional GitHub README

## For Whom is This Project?
FleetFlow is designed for:
- **Fleet operators** (logistics, transport, delivery, rental, and service companies)
- **Dispatchers** and **fleet managers** who need real-time control and visibility
- **Business owners** seeking to optimize costs, compliance, and asset utilization
- **Developers** and startups building SaaS fleet management solutions

## Why Was This Project Made?
Managing a modern fleet is complex. Companies struggle with:
- Double-booking vehicles or drivers
- Missed maintenance and compliance issues
- No real-time analytics on costs, utilization, or performance
- Manual, error-prone processes (spreadsheets, phone calls)

FleetFlow was built to solve these pain points with a **modular, state-driven, full-stack system** that automates business rules, tracks every asset, and provides actionable insights.

## Market Impact
If launched, FleetFlow would:
- **Reduce operational costs** by preventing double-dispatch, optimizing routes, and tracking expenses
- **Increase uptime** by automating maintenance schedules and compliance
- **Boost transparency** with full audit trails and analytics
- **Enable rapid scaling** for logistics startups and established fleets alike
- **Modernize** the industry with a user-friendly, cloud-ready, open-source platform

## How to Use
- See the main [README.md](README.md) for setup, usage, and architecture
- All code is clean, modular, and production-ready
- No unnecessary files or bloat — only what you need to run, test, and deploy
